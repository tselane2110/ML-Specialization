# What does this repo include?

Implementation (from scratch) of:
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression

Implemented Gradient Descent:
* Without regularization
* with regularization

After your model gets trained/coverged, it will show the <u>learning curve</u> as well :))

Note: Not the perfect implementation ofcourse but it reflects my learning and understanding of the concepts in depth!
